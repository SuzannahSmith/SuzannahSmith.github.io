              <p>July - August 2013: Suzannah's first official job was working at a day camp for kids in Quebec. This was part of the YMCA's Summer Work Student Exchange six-week program. It was a great opportunity to explore Quebec, practice French, and earn a good paycheck.</p>
              <p> June 2014 - April 2015: The summer after she graduated from high school she began working at a Tim Hortons in Fredericton. She continued working there throughout her first year of university, but then moved on to the Computer Science co-op program.</p>
              <p> May - August 2015: Her first Computer Science internship was at Professional Quality Assurance (PQA) in Fredericton. She worked there from May to August 2015. Some of her tasks included manually testing websties, testing the content of video-based courses, and writing detailed reviews and bug reports.<p>
              <p>Sept - Dec 2015: After returning to school, Suzannah worked as a tutor for first year students. She tutored in Java, Intro to Computer Science, and Discrete Mathmatics courses. </p>
              <p>Jan-April 2016: For her second work term, Suzannah moved to Charlottetown, PEI to work at SpryPoint. She really enjoyed learning web development, and worked on the backend and frontend of several web apps. She also performed some database management.</p>
              <p>May - August 2016: While doing a summer study term back in Fredericton, Suzannah was hired by Natalia Stakhanova to develop the curriculum for a web design class for kids. She designed the course outline and materials for 10 two-hour classes.</p>
              <p>Sept - Dec 2016: Suzannah completed her third work term at Eigen Innovations in Fredericton. She focused mainly on building new features for the front end of their AngularJS web app. Working with the other members of the frontend team, she researched best practices and planned the major refactoring of the app. She also set up automated testing using Browserstack, and wrote unit tests.</p>
              <p>At the same time, she helped teach a weekly web design class to a small group of young girls, with the materials that she designed. It was fun to see girls getting excited about the things they could build with technology. At the end of the course, each student had completed their own simple HTML and CSS website.</p>
